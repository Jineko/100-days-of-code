# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: September 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the First HTML basics on freecode-camp

**Thoughts**: I'm finding that my spelling mistakes and causing frustration and issues with the coding. Heck me. So far I'm proud I was able to finish that much.

### Day 2: September 15, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Did 14 of the 44 Challegnes of basic CCS on freecode-camp.

**Thoughts**: Why do these uncoth bastards use Color and not Colour? Who the hell? I remember learning how to do HTML for coloured text a long long time ago and remember it being much more complicated. I'm sure things have gotten easier overtime.

### Day 3: September 16, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Did more of the CCS challenge/learning on freecode-camp.

**Thoughts** I have already hit the point of needing to google how to wrtie code bits I had already learned. Like marking something with an ID. Luckily for me I already know the secret to coding is to look up what you can't remember and that it's okay to not remember every little bit. It's more important that I know I need the thing, then how to do it, with coding. Still having fun with it, but lost focus early tonight. Still Trucking along.

### Day 4: September 17 2021
**Today's Prgoress** Continued to learn more stuff about CSS.

**Thoughts**: Learning a lot about style and setting up classes. Kinda forgot to update thie for a few days, was only worried about twitter. Ha.

### Day 5: September 18 2021
**Today's Prgoress**: Was very distracted this night and didn't make much progress.

**Thoughts**: This is another time where I had to look up stuff I just read the other day. At least knowing what I'm looking for, like typing CSS Style, gives me exactly what I need. So as long as I know what I need, forgetting how to do it is not a problem.

**Today's Prgoress** Not much. Headache and eyes hurt.

**Thoughts**: Tonight my anixety was really high so I didn't get much done.

### Day6: Setember 21 2021
**Today's Progress** Finished the CSS basics on freeCodeCamp, saw a Penguin waving. 

**Thoughts** Once again foiled for a bit by spelling Gray as Grey. The HTML understood it but the challenge didn't want to finish because of it. Seeing the penguin wave was pretty neat, can't wait till I'm able to code that kind of stuff myself.

### Day8: September 27 2021
**Today's Progress**: More applied visual design.

**Thoughts** Honestly not sure if I'm really getting this all. Mostly I'm just doing the challenges, I watched a video that said a good coder tinkers with their code but I don't know how to even begin that.

### Day9: September 28 2021
**Today's Progress**: More Applied Visual Design 

**Thoughts** I think there are a lot of concepts I'm missing out on and not fully understanding. Honestly it's getting more stress full. As can be noted I've missed a few days in a row. It's hard to remain consistant.
