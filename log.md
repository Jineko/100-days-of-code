# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: September 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the First HTML basics on freecode-camp

**Thoughts**: I'm finding that my spelling mistakes and causing frustration and issues with the coding. Heck me. So far I'm proud I was able to finish that much.

### Day 2: September 15, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Did 14 of the 44 Challegnes of basic CCS on freecode-camp.

**Thoughs**: Why do these uncoth bastards use Color and not Colour? Who the hell? I remember learning how to do HTML for coloured text a long long time ago and remember it being much more complicated. I'm sure things have gotten easier overtime.
